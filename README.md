# TYPO3 fe_performance

This extension helps to improve frontend performance in TYPO3 CMS.


## Features

* Minification of JS (files and inline)
* Exclude per page inline JS from concatenation
* Move default JS to footer
* Minify all generated HTML


## What it does

TYPO3 does gzip compression but no minification of JS files. This extension adds
JavaScript minification to files and inline scripts by using the
`jsCompressHandler` hook. Usage: `config.compressJs` needs to be enabled, gzip
compression works as before.

When using `config.removeDefaultJS = external` TYPO3 generates temp JavaScript
files with all per page inline JS and some default JS. This way users need to
download code from static files multiple times, just because its merged with per
page inline JS. You could exclude these files from concatenation with static
files (includeJS and includeJSFooter) by enabling `excludeInlineJsFromConcatenation`
option in extension manager.

When using `includeJSFooter` to add JS files it's a little annoying the only
remaining JS file in header is the default one. You could use option
`moveInlineJsToFooter` in EM to move the file to the footer section.
